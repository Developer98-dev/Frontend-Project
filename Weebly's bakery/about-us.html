        <p>  Mr. and Mrs. Weebly have been running a local bakery called Weebly's Bakery for an odd 25-30 years.</p>
        <p>Their nephew made a website for them in 1995 which is not responsive. This is a problem for her since nobody can use her website easily. This means when they navigate their website, users have trouble finding their phone number or location easily. Neither can users see their bakery items because the images are either too big or small.</p>
